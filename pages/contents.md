# Interactive Lecture Notes

This page links to the interactive notes and exercises for Logic part of CS208 Logic & Algorithms.

## Part 0: Propositional Logic

Part 0 of this course is a (re)introduction to the basic concepts of Propositional Logic.

1. [Syntax](prop-logic-syntax.html): what are the valid sequences of symbols that we can write down? Which ones are logical formulas?
2. [Semantics](prop-logic-semantics.html): what do those symbols mean?
3. [Truth Tables, Satisfiability, and Validity](truth-tables.html): An effective way to compute the meaning of a logical formula, and two kinds of statements we can make about a formula.
4. [Entailment](entailment.html): A generalised form of validity. What does it mean to say a formula is true under some assumptions?

## Part 1: Logical Modelling

In Part 1, we use logical modelling to describe and solve problems.

1. [Introduction](logical-modelling-intro.html) to Logical Modelling and the Logical Modelling tool.
2. [The Wizard's Pets](wizards-pets.html), introducing some common kinds of constraints through a toy example.
3. [Patterns](patterns.html) for writing logical constraints.
4. [A fruity exercise](fruit-exercise.html) for you to do.
5. [The Package Installation Problem](packages.html).
6. [SAT solvers](sat.html), the underlying technology.
7. TBD: More features of the tool.
8. TBD: Resource allocation problems.
9. TBD: Circuit equivalence checking.
10. TBD: Checking access control rules.

## Part 2: Deductive proof

In Part 2, we strive for truth through proof.

1. TBD...
