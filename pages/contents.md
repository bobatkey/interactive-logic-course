## Part 1: Logical Modelling

In Part 1, we use logical modelling to describe and solve problems.

1. [Introduction](logical-modelling-intro.html) to Logical Modelling and the Logical Modelling tool.
2. [The Wizard's Pets](wizards-pets.html), introducing some common kinds of constraints through a toy example.
3. [Patterns](patterns.html) for writing logical constraints.
4. [A fruity exercise](fruit-exercise.html) for you to do.
5. [The Package Installation Problem](packages.html).
6. [SAT solvers](sat.html), the underlying technology.
7. [How to handle bigger problems](domains-and-parameters.html) with domains and parameters.
8. [Resource allocation problems](resource-alloc.html), which are a kind of graph colouring problem. (*under construction*)
9. [Converting to CNF](converting-to-cnf.html)
10. [Circuits, Gates and Formulas](circuits.html), where we look at encoding logic gates as clauses, so we can get the solver to answer questions about circuits.

**Coursework:** [Coursework 1 is here](coursework1.html).

## Part 2: Deductive proof

In Part 2, we strive for truth through proof. We will be primarily using an proof editor to construct natural deduction proofs. Exercises with fixed things to prove are embedded in each of the pages. You can also enter your own things to prove [on this page](prover.html).

1. [Introduction to Deductive Proof](proof-intro.html), which describes the general idea of proof systems, and introduces a small example of a proof system inspired by biology.
2. [Natural Deduction and the rules for And](natural-deduction-intro.html). Natural Deduction is a style of proof system that places a particular emphasis on how assumptions are used, and on how the rules for each connective come in introduction and elimination pairs.
3. [Proof rules for Implication](proof-implication.html). Implication allows us to make conditional statements that we prove by temporarily making assumptions.
4. [Proof rules for Or and Not](proof-or.html), which complete the rules for Propositional Logic.
5. [Soundness and Completeness, and some Philosophy](sound-complete-meaning.html). The system so far is sound, but is it complete? Should it be complete?
6. Introducing Predicate Logic
7. Upgrading Natural Deduction for Predicate Logic
8. Proof rules for Predicate Logic (tutorial questions)
9. Predicate Logic Semantics
10. Checking Models of Predicate Logic
11. Equality
12. Induction
13. More Induction
14. Metatheory and GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorem
