# Interactive Lecture Notes

This page links to the interactive notes and exercises for Logic part of CS208 Logic & Algorithms.

## Logical Modelling

In the first part of the course, we use logical modelling to describe and solve problems.

1. [Introduction](logical-modelling-intro.html) to Logical Modelling and the Logical Modelling tool.
2. [The Wizard's Pets](wizards-pets.html), introducing some common kinds of constraints through a toy example.
3. [Patterns](patterns.html) for writing logical constraints.
4. [A fruity exercise](fruit-exercise.html) for you to do.
5. [The Package Installation Problem](packages.html).
6. [SAT solvers](sat.html), the underlying technology.
7. Resource allocation problems.
8. Circuit equivalence checking.
9. Checking access control rules.

## Deductive proof

In the second part of the course, we strive for truth through proof.
