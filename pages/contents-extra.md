## Part 0: Propositional Logic

Part 0 of this course is a (re)introduction to the basic concepts of Propositional Logic.

1. [Syntax](prop-logic-syntax.html): what are the valid sequences of symbols that we can write down? Which ones are logical formulas?
2. [Semantics](prop-logic-semantics.html): what do those symbols mean? What do formulas made form the symbols mean?
3. [Truth Tables, Satisfiability, and Validity](truth-tables.html): An effective way to compute the meaning of a logical formula, and two kinds of statements we can make about a formula.
4. [Entailment](entailment.html): A generalised form of validity. What does it mean to say a formula is true under some assumptions?
5. [Beyond the binary: Three-valued Logic](three-valued-logic.html). We will primarily study *two*-valued logic (`true` and `false`), but what if we have more than two truth values?
